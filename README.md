Google Map GPS Cell Phone Tracker

Status update for Jan 14, 2014. Version 3 of GpsTracker is complete. This was a very big change from the last version. It's been updated with ios, android, windowsPhone and java me/j2me phone clients and the servers have all been updated as well. Please let me know how it works, good or bad and create an issue if you find a problem. Thanks and enjoy the software, Nick.
