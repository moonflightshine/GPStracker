##### Google Map Gps Cell Phone Tracker

This project allows you to track cell phones periodically. For instance every minute or every five minutes. You can watch the cell phone being tracked in real time using google maps and you can store and reload routes easily.

You have the choice of two server stacks. Either using asp.net and sql server or using php and mysql. Historically, devs have downloaded the asp.net server project 2 to 1 over the php project. I have included both now in the same download but you only need to use one.

##### Status update for Jan 14, 2014 
Version 3 of GpsTracker is complete. This was a very big change from the last version. It's been updated with ios, android, windowsPhone and java me/j2me phone clients and the servers have all been updated as well. Please let me know how it works, good or bad and create an issue if you find a problem. Thanks and enjoy the software, Nick.

ps. I will be writing tutorials and documentation shortly.
